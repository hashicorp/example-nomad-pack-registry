# Example Nomad Pack Registry

This repository is meant to be used as a reference when writing custom pack registries for [Nomad Pack](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad-pack).

See the [documentation on Writing Packs and Registries](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad-pack/blob/main/docs/writing-packs.md) for more information.

To get started writing your own pack, make a directory with your pack name. Use the `hello_world` pack as
an example for file structure and contents.
